### ‚ú® About The Project

**Nonsense Patrol** is a comprehensive token analysis service developed by the Department of Financial Nonsense. Our mission is to bring clarity to a chaotic ecosystem by providing traders and investors with the tools they need to perform quick and effective due diligence on Solana tokens.

The scanner combines on-chain data, market statistics, and security checks to generate a single, easy-to-understand **Trust Score**, helping users identify potential risks before they invest.

### üõ°Ô∏è Key Analysis Features

Nonsense Patrol evaluates tokens across several key vectors to determine its Trust Score:

* **Smart Contract Security**: Checks for critical contract-level risks, such as whether the mint authority has been renounced, if a freeze authority exists, or if the token's metadata is mutable.
* **Liquidity Health**: Determines if the token's liquidity pool (LP) is burned, locked, or remains unlocked (a major red flag).
* **Holder Distribution**: Analyzes the concentration of top holders (whales) after filtering out exchange and protocol-owned wallets to reveal the true ownership structure.
* **Threat Intelligence**: Scans the token creator's wallet and top holder wallets against a database of known hackers and scammers.
* **Price Impact Simulation**: Simulates the potential market cap collapse if the largest holders were to sell their tokens, giving insight into the token's stability.

### How to Add the Widget to Your Site

We use a modern Web Component for a simple and secure integration. Installation is a two-step process:

#### Step 1: Add the Widget Script

Place the following `<script>` tag just before the closing `</body>` tag in your HTML file. This only needs to be done once per page.
```html
<script src="[https://dfn.wtf/badge.js](https://dfn.wtf/badge.js)" defer></script>
